# Electricity maps - CO2 intensity profiles

In this folder hourly profiles for the CO2 intensity of electricity from the grid can be stored.
These are available under https://app.electricitymaps.com/. However, the are only free to use for strictly 
non-commercial use. For commercial use, a license must be obtained from electricitymaps.com.

For this reason, no profiles are included in this repository. If no CO2 intensity profiles are provided, static 
default values ``CO2_g_per_kWh_EL_LCA`` and ``CO2_g_per_kWh_EL_LCA`` are assumed, which can be set in const.py.
