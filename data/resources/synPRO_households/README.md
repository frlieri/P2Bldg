# synPRO - demand profiles

- Household electricity load profiles have been generated with the [synPRO](https://synpro-lastprofile.de/) tool from Fraunhofer ISE.
- synPRO was only used to prepare the household electricity profiles 
(hot water demand profiles are created with DHWcalc and EV-charging profiles are inherently generated in P2Bldg)
